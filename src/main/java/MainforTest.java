        /* Answer to some questions
        Code coverage can be a good metric but always depends on the context
        100% code coverage does not mean we dont have bugs in our code, it doesnt ensure that all
        test cases have been covered. It kind of gives us a basic idea on how many parts are getting executed and we need
        to make further test cases on.
        We can have a code coverage over 90% without testing all situations(if we cover a good part of our code with tests we will have a higher percentage)

        Using mocks avoids having extra test cases

        Cons
        It can take up a lot of space in tests
        With mocks, the expected behavior of your dependencies is within in your test - not in separate classes
